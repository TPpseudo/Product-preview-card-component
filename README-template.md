## My process

This was my first time using CSS variables, reset and grid so quite a steep learning curve. I focused on the mobile version first after which I created the desktop version.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Using the feedback given provided on my previous challenges I made use of the following for the first time:

*CSS Reset
*CSS variables
\*CSS Grid

### Continued development

This project allowed me to take my first steps into the world of CSS Grid. Looking forward to learn more about the possibilities using this.

CSS Reset did not seem as simple as I thought it would be. There are a lot of different opinions on CSS reset vs. Normalize out there.
